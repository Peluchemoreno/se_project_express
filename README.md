# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project is the back end for my WTWR project. Its current level of functionality implements routing for various CRUD operations completed within the front end of my WTWR project as well as validating the data before it's sent to the database.

## Current functionality is as follows:

### Users

- Create a single user
- Return the entire list of users
- Return a single user by their ID

---

### Items

- Create a clothing item
- Return the entire list of clothing items
- Return a single item by its ID
- Like an item
- Dislike an item
- Delete an item from the database

---

## Technoligies used

---

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Postman
- MongoDB
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Validator npm package
- Mongoose

---

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

## Future Plans

- The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
